# Anomaly Detection (MVTec)


This project implements an **Zero-shot anomaly detection** for industrial inspection using MVTec AD dataset and working with Carpet specifically.
It supports training a memory bank, generating anomaly heatmaps, and evaluating results — locally, in Docker, or on cloud VMs.
