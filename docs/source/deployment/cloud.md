The application was deployed on Google Cloud Run using a two-service architecture, separating the frontend and the backend components. 

The frontend service provides the user interface and is exposed through a public URL automatically generated by Cloud Run: 

```bash
https://frontend-445436263618.europe-west1.run.app/

```
which is used by users to interact with the application. The final version works with the BentoML backend service, as it provides a robust and scalable solution for serving the machine learning model. The frontend communicates with the backend through its Cloud Run endpoint, enabling a clean separation of concerns and independent monitoring of each service.
